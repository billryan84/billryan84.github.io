<H3>
Reduction Procedures using IRAF: Preparing images for photometry</H3>

<H4>
Note: Any page numbers refer to CCD reduction manual by Massey, et al</H4>
Change directory to <TT>/flattest</TT> or whatever directory that you would
like to work in.
<H4>
1) Use <TT>implot</TT> on flat image to confirm bias and trim values given
in Step 2</H4>
Type:
<PRE>implot b0025.imh</PRE>
Look at left and right edges (remember to use <TT>e</TT> to expand these
regions; <TT>r</TT> to replot full image) to determine what columns to
keep (first pair of trim parameters) and the overscan region (first pair
of bias parameters) to measure the bias offset. Type <TT>c </TT>to plot
a column to determine the second pair of trim and bias parameters (top
and bottom of portion of image to keep). Type <TT>q</TT> to exit <TT>implot</TT>.
<H4>
2) Subtract columnbias and trim using <I>noao.imred.bias.colbias</I></H4>
To load the package&nbsp; <I>noao.imred.bias.colbias,</I> type at the 'cl'
prompt:
<PRE>cl> noao</PRE>

<PRE>cl> imred</PRE>

<PRE>cl> bias</PRE>
Create a file list with the names of&nbsp; all&nbsp; images.
<PRE>files *.imh > imlist</PRE>
The routine, <TT>colbias</TT>, should appear as one of the available packages
loaded. Type:
<PRE>epar colbias</PRE>
and modify the following parameters
<PRE>input = @imlist</PRE>

<PRE>output = @imlist</PRE>

<PRE>bias = [1030:1042,2:1020]</PRE>

<PRE>trim = [10:1010,2:1020]</PRE>

<PRE>function = chebyshev</PRE>
Remember to type 'control-d' to save changes.

<P>Run <TT>colbias</TT>.
<BR>Continually hit <TT>return</TT> and <TT>q</TT> (in image window) to
confirm.
<BR>&nbsp;Note any images that look 'funny'.
<H4>
3) Create master bias frame with package<I> imred.ccdred.zerocombine</I></H4>
Create a file list with the names of&nbsp; all of the bias frames.
<PRE>files b* > biaslist</PRE>
will write the names of all b-series files to the file 'biaslist'. Then
use <TT>vi</TT> to delete names from list (i.e., filenames that are not
bias images). Also, delete any image names that you determined were 'funny'
in Step 2.&nbsp; In the <TT>vi </TT>editor, use arrow keys to navigate
and <TT>dd</TT> to delete a line. Type <TT>:wq</TT> to 'write/quit', i.e.,
to save file and quit. You can also use the pico editor by typing <TT>!pico
filename</TT>.

<P>Load&nbsp;<I> imred.ccdred </I>(as described above) and epar <TT>zerocombine</TT>.
Enter '@' and then the name of this file (<TT>@biaslist</TT>) in the 'input'
entry. Leave the rest of the zerocombine options at default (page 13) With
the default, the output master biasframe will be 'Zero'. Then run <TT>zerocombine</TT>
to create master bias frame.
<H4>
4) Subtract master bias frame (Zero) from all flat and data images</H4>
Copy the imlist to filelist (<TT>!cp imlist filelist</TT>) and edit filelist
to remove the names of all
<BR>bias images and 'bad' images (again, see Step 2).

<P>Use the <TT>imarith</TT> function (general image arithmetic function
- in this case, subtracting each bias frame (Zero) pixel value from each
image frame pixel value). epar <TT>imarith</TT> and set the following values:
<PRE>operand1 = @filelist</PRE>

<PRE>op = -</PRE>

<PRE>operand2 = Zero</PRE>

<PRE>result = @filelist</PRE>

<DL>Run <TT>imarith</TT>. This will subtract the image, <TT>Zero</TT>,
from every image named in <TT>filelist</TT>, writing over the original
image (result is the same as operand1)</DL>

<H4>
5) Create master flat field.</H4>
Create file list containing names of flat field images. Type
<PRE>cp filelist vflatlist</PRE>
and use vi or pico to delete non-flatfield images. epar <TT>flatcombine</TT>
with mostly default settings from page 20 except:
<PRE>input = vflatlist</PRE>

<PRE>output = flatV</PRE>

<PRE>process = no</PRE>
It might be a good idea to view each flat first before including them in
the list. Run <TT>flatcombine</TT> to create master V-flatfield 'flatV'.
<H4>
6) Normalize flat using <TT>imstat</TT> and <TT>imarith</TT>.</H4>
At the<TT> cl></TT> prompt, type:
<PRE>imstat flatV fields="image,mode"</PRE>
to determine the mode of the pixel values (most frequently occuring value).
I got 13288 for the flat field images that I used - yours may be different.
Normalize the pixel values by typing:
<PRE>imarith flatV / 13288 flatV</PRE>
Take a look at final 'flatV' with <TT>disp</TT> and <TT>implot</TT> (pixel
values should hover about 1)
<H4>
7) Perform flatfielding using <TT>imarith</TT>.</H4>
Make list of object images (files tra* > objlist) or just use image name
(if only one such as a0041.imh). Divide each image by the master flatfield
(flatV):
<PRE>imarith @objlist / flatV @objlist</PRE>
Do the images look any cleaner than when you started? (i.e.,&nbsp; do you
really believe that the process worked?). You might compare one of the
finished products with the original image.
