<h3>
Aperture Photometry Exercise using IRAF</h3>
1) On local machine, start an <i>xgterm</i> window and an <i>ds9</i> window.
To do this, type
<pre>xgterm &amp;</pre>

<pre>ds9 &amp;</pre>
Note: Implicitly assume that you type a&nbsp; <tt>&lt;return></tt> after
each <tt>formatted </tt>line. Explicit <tt>&lt;return></tt>'s are only
shown where they might not be obvoious.
<p>2) If you are running IRAF locally, skip to Step 4 .
<p>If you are working on a remote machine, log into '<tt>gaspra</tt>' in
the <i>xgterm</i> window:
<pre>telnet gaspra</pre>

<pre>username</pre>

<pre>password</pre>
3) To start iraf in the <i>xgterm</i> window, type
<pre>setenv IMTDEV inet:5137:localmachinename</pre>

<pre>cl</pre>
where <i>localmachinename</i> is the name (or IP number) of the workstation
at which you are sitting (e.g., <i>physics1</i>).
<p>Note: If the script 'iraf' is in your /bin directory, this can be accomplished
by simply typing
<pre>iraf&nbsp; machinename. (e.g., 'iraf physics1').</pre>
You are now running the computational part of iraf on the the machine <i>gaspra</i>
and will be displaying images and results on <i>localmachinename</i>.
<p>4) In the <i>xgterm</i> window, type
<pre>cd</pre>

<pre>ls</pre>

<pre>cd m67</pre>
This series of commands took you to the directory 'astro', which is your
IRAF home directory. The 'ls' command lists the files and directories.
Then you changed to the directory 'm67' where the photometry exercise files
are located. Now you would like to display an image.
<p>5) Convert image from FITS (standard) to IRAF format. Type
<pre>ls</pre>
to see which images exist the current directory. Now type
<pre>rfits</pre>
and respond with
<pre>m67v</pre>

<pre>m67v</pre>
You should now see (after typing 'ls') the file 'm67v.imh' - this is the
m67v image in IRAF format. Now type
<pre>disp</pre>
and respond with
<pre>m67v</pre>
and a few <tt>&lt;return></tt>'s. You should see the image displayed in
the <i>ds9</i> window.
<p>Check this for ds9 modifications----------------------------------
<br>Under the <i>Options</i> menu, click on <i>Control Panel</i>. To magnify
the image, click on <i>Zoom In</i>. Position the mouse in the lower right
corner of the ximtool window, click and hold the button down, and then
resize the window until the complete image fits
<br>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^.
<p>6) We now would like to learn a bit about the image. Position the mouse
in the <i>xgterm</i> window and click (i.e., make the window active). Then
type
<pre>imexamine</pre>
A circular cursor should appear in the image window. Position this over
a star (click the mouse to ensure that the window is active), and then
type
<pre>r</pre>
on the keyboard. A radial plot of the star's intensity should appear in
a new window. You may have to use the mouse to bring this image in front
of the others on your screen. Experiment with <i>imexamine</i> a bit by
positioning the circular cursor and trying out the following commands (only
the letter is needed):
<pre>s&nbsp; (surface plot)</pre>

<pre>e&nbsp; (contour plot)</pre>

<pre>c&nbsp; (plot a complete column of the image)</pre>

<pre>l&nbsp; (plot a complete line of the image)</pre>
7) Now we need to get ready to do some photometry. First we need to get
an idea of the width of the stellar images. To do this, use the 'r' command
in <i>imexamine</i>. At the base of the radial plot window, look at the
number in the far right. This is the full width at half-maximum (FWHM)
in pixels, i.e., the width of the stars image where the intensity is one
half of the central value or greater. Does this number seem to agree with
the radial plot? Remember, the x-axis is the radius, not the diameter.
Measure the FWHM for a couple different stars and get a rough average.
(Should be somewhere between 2.1 and 2.3). When you are done, type
<pre>q</pre>
to quit <i>imexamine</i>.
<p>8) To load the IRAF photometry packages, type
<pre>digiphot</pre>

<pre>apphot</pre>
at the <i>cl </i>prompt. We will use the task <i>qphot</i> to do the photometry.
However, we will also learn a new IRAF trick at this point. We have been
entering responses to commands interactively until now. However, all IRAF
commands have a parameter file with default responses. To modify the <i>qphot
</i>parameter
file, type
<pre>epar qphot</pre>
in the <i>xgterm</i> window. Enter the following parameters by using the
arrow key to position the cursor, entering the value, then hitting .
<pre>image = m67v</pre>

<pre>annulus = 8.0</pre>

<pre>dannulus = 4.0</pre>

<pre>aperture = 6.0</pre>

<pre>output = m67v.mag</pre>

<pre>zmag = 22.766</pre>
The zmag entry is optional at this step. However, this value 'rigs' the
zero-point of the results to be consistent with the v-magnitude of the
reference star in the m67 image. When you are finished, type
<pre>:wq</pre>
to save the file. Start the photometry program by typing
<pre>qphot</pre>
and repeatedly hitting &lt;return> to select the default values. A round
cursor should appear in the image window. Center this over the reference
star and type
<pre>i</pre>
A window should appear querying you for the redius of extraction box.
<br>Enter
<pre>20</pre>
and hit
<pre>&lt;return></pre>
A radial plot of the reference star should appear. Note that it is contaminated
by a neighboring star at about 11.5 pixels. We will now confirm that the
aperture and annulus values entered previously are appropriate. Type
<pre>v</pre>
Successively hit
<pre>&lt;return></pre>
viewing the position of the inner and outer sky radii and the photometry
aperture. The vertical line will position itself at the default values
each time. When you reach the <i>Mark apertures step</i>, type
<pre>q</pre>

<pre>q</pre>
and the round cursor should reappear in the image window. Click to make
the window active and then type
<pre>w</pre>
to save the parameters just confirmed. Now place the round cursor over
each star (measure the reference star last, i.e., make it star #11) and
press the
<pre>spacebar</pre>
to measure each the magnitude. You should notice the results in the <i>xgterm</i>
window. When you are finished, type
<pre>q</pre>
in the <i>xgterm</i> window, then move the cursor to the image window,
click the mouse (to make window active) and type (this is quirky - the
order of typing the q's is crucial)
<pre>q</pre>
You should now have a file 'm67v.mag' containing your results. Type
<pre>ls</pre>
to confirm this. To view this file, type
<pre>page m67v.mag</pre>
Hit the spacebar to view the next page and hit 'q' when you are finished.
This file has more info than you care about at the moment. Therefore, we
will use the <i>txdump</i> utility to extract the info that we want. Type
<pre>epar txdump</pre>

<pre>and enter</pre>

<pre>textfile = m67v.mag</pre>

<pre>fields = id,mag,merr</pre>

<pre>:wq</pre>
Type
<pre>txdump</pre>
to see the star id, magnitude, and the error in the mag displayed to the
screen. To save these results to a file, type
<pre>txdump > results.dat</pre>
or any other filename after the '>'. Compare your results with those shown
in the CCD lab handout. When you are finished, type
<pre>lo</pre>
to exit IRAF and then
<pre>lo</pre>
again to logout of <i>gaspra</i>.
