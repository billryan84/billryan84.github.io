&nbsp;Description of program anliz</H1>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT SIZE=+1> Program anliz
uses data from qphot to calculate and write; time, deltamag&nbsp; and error
bars. The data from qphot is saved in a mag file (*.mag.1). In order to
use the program the mag files must be text dumped in to a&nbsp; results
file.&nbsp;</FONT> <FONT SIZE=+1>The asteriod must be the first object
the asteriod is ID number 1. The compstrars are ID number 2 and geater.
The program can use as many results files as needed. It will continue asking
for a results file (input) until the user quits. The option to quit the
program is given when it asks for the time offset. The program will get
the name of the input file and open the file. The program reads the information
from the file. The information it retrieves is used to calculate time,
delta magnitudes and error bars. The program has an option to do corrections
of light time and magnitude. The program automatically does a correction
for the integration time. A option is given to write the results in standard
form or in Harris format. The Harris format is needed to use the Harris
program. The standard format is used to check the comp stars and make an
estimate of the period. The program writes this data in a output file that
the user gives.&nbsp; The option is also given to the user to leave out
certain comparison stars. The output file is not changed. (Warnings are
give when entering global and when entering nightly data info.) When the
program is quit "finished reading" is displayed on the screen.</FONT>
