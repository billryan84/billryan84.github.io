<p>Although not due until early November, an impatient addition to the
Ryan family began kicking his way out three weeks early on the morning
of October 17. He is the son of <a href="../index.html">William</a> and
<a href="http://users.gilanet.com/~eryan/">Eileen</a>
Ryan and is named after a multitude of William's on his father's side.
However, to avoid the Bill, Jr. syndrome, he will tentatively go by Liam
- and early name choice of his mother's. His middle name is inspired by
his mother's grandfather, Andrezej C(z)upta and a distant ancestor on his
father's side, <a href="http://www.shiawasseehistory.com/porter.html">General
Andrew Porter</a>. Andrew Porter was a schoolmaster in Philadelphia before
becoming an officer in the Marines during the American Revolution. Family
folklore has it that he killed a fellow officer in a duel for mocking his
profession as a math teacher. Following his court martial, he somehow got
himself promoted to general. Whether based in fact or not, this story was
too cool not to be carried on as part of Liam's name.

the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope.
